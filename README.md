# ColorPalletePicker

**Download the whole folder and then run the application from within or else it might not work**

Color Palette picker is an experimental image processing program

	-Drag and drop an Image and select a palette of 8 colors

	-Drag and drop another image and the program will recreate that image using 
     	 Only the previously selected colors

	-There are some sample images to try out in the data folder but any image will work

-If you download Processing and open the .pde file for the project there are some fun settings to play with like drawing pixels as circles, pixel size, randomization, and a semi functional HSB mode
Just play with the variables at the top of the code (they’re labelled for you)

Notes:

-If you want to export your selected color palette into photoshop or something there’s a file called Pallette.txt that contains the last selected colors buttttt…...It’s all 7-9ish digit negative numbers so I’m not sure if that translates to other programs or not. If that doesn’t work email me and I can make an rgb export easily (or if you have any experience with processing you can easily use the red() green() blue() functions to extract the rgb values)
